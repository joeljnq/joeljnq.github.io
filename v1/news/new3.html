    <h1>Underdog</h1>
    <p>This review was written for the theatrical release of "Underdog"."Underdog", the live-action Disney film based on
        the Saturday morning cartoon series that ran from 1964-73, has a tail-wagging sense of wit and fun but gets
        undone by an increasingly lame story and physical gags in the latter phases of the movie. Still, the movie isn't
        nearly as bad as you would expect when the studio holds its only press screening the night before a national
        opening. The film kids superhero movies even as it opens the way for clever canine jokes that do make the movie
        something of an underdog.
        The movie's hero is a lovable Beagle nicknamed Shoeshine that cop-turned-security guard Dan (a subdued and
        genuinely likable Jim Belushi) finds on a street one fateful night in Capitol City. He and his son Jack Alex
        Neuberger) are involved in a real-life challenge of coping with the death of the wife and mother, which gives
        this cartoonish comedy emotional heft.

        Unbeknownst to either male, Shoeshine has been accidentally transformed into a canine crime-fighter in the lab
        of one Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage in a peerless bit of comic clowning), a mad scientist who, as he
        says, prefers the term "visionary." The dog can blast through walls, lift impossibly heavy objects, think faster
        than a human and, yes, he can talk. (Voice supplied with a down-home sensibility by Jason Lee.)

        It takes a while for Shoeshine and Jack to get comfortable with these brilliant pet tricks, which makes for much
        of the fun in the early going. So while Shoeshine and Jack get their superhero act going -- which includes
        pinpointing the right costume after several false starts -- Dr. Simon, his face hideously rearranged by an
        industrial accident to look truly diabolical, and his wonderfully dense yet resourceful henchman Cal (a
        narcissistic Patrick Warburton) find new ways to do evil badly.

        So the movie, under the direction of Frederik Du Chau (who directed that other critter comedy "Racing Stripes"),
        seems to have many things going for it as a family comedy. Alas, it fritters this all away with a "Batman"-style
        plot to destroy Capitol City by Dr. Simon and a gang of bad dogs led by a tough called Riff Raff ("Everybody
        Loves Raymond's" Brad Garrett).

        The script by Adam Rifkin, Joe Piscatella & Craig A. Williams doesn't so much go to the dogs as rely too heavily
        on dogs doing things cute or amazing to take audience minds off a stalled story.

        The pet tricks are quite good, and the animation of the animal mouths and the actors' voices synch well. This
        includes Amy Adams as Shoeshine's love interest, a saucy Spaniel named Polly. Other effects are just so-so, and
        the production design reflects the film's divided sensibility: Some sets and locations have true grit while
        others feel like backlot fakery.
