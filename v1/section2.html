                    TV interview since his tragic death.
                    Jansen died on Feb. 19 of an enlarged heart at age just 28.</h2>
                <p>While chatting about her new movie “Scream VI”, Hayden briefly mentioned the late actor.
                    Michael Strahan offered his condolences during the interview, before Hayden thanked him and said:
                    “Hes right here with me.”
                    Hayden’s comments come after her family, including their mother Lesley Vogel and father Skip
