                <h2>STEVE Harvey has been left "scared" of a Family Feud contestant after their intense face-off
                    response on stage..</h2>
                <p>The gameshow's network shared the clip of the interaction on the Family Feud Instagram account.During
                    one of the episode's contestant face-offs, Steve, 66, asked: "Tell me something that's known as a
                    bloodsucker?"

                    Laura, one of the two players competing for their teams immediately smashed the buzzer and growled
                    out: "A man!"

                    The comedian appeared to be disturbed by the answer as he stood motionless with a pleading, "help
                    me" expression on his face.

                    The studio audience could be heard laughing at Laura's response and the game show host's fearful
                    reaction to it.
