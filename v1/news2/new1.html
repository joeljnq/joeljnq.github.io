    <h1>Hayden Panettiere paid tribute to her brother Jansen on Mondays “Good Morning America” in her first TV interview
        since his tragic death. Jansen died on Feb. 19 of an enlarged heart at age just 28.</h1>
    <p>While chatting about her new movie “Scream VI”, Hayden briefly mentioned the late actor.

        Michael Strahan offered his condolences during the interview, before Hayden thanked him and said: “He’s right
        here with me.”
        Haydens comments come after her family, including their mother Lesley Vogel and father Skip Panettiere,
        released a statement confirming Jansens cause of death to ABC News.

        The message read, “Though it offers little solace, the Medical Examiner reported Jansens sudden passing was due
        to cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), coupled with aortic valve complications.”

        The family paid tribute to the late actor in the statement, which read: “Jansens heart could be seen in his
        eyes, and his charm in his brilliant, engaging smile; his soul in his masterful and revealing paintings, and the
        joy of life in his dry wit.”
        They added, “His charisma, warmth, compassion for others, and his creative spirit will live forever in our
        hearts and in the hearts of all whom he encountered.”

        The family shared, “We sincerely appreciate the outpouring of love and support towards our family as we navigate
        this unthinkable loss, and ask that we be gifted our privacy during this time of mourning.

        “We love you so much Jansen and you will be in our hearts forever.”
        Jansen, who is five years younger than his sister Hayden, starred in the likes of “Even Stevens”, “Blue’s Clues”
        and “Ice Age: The Meltdown” as a child actor, as well as Nickelodeons “The Xs”.

        Jansen also worked with his sister on 2004s “Tiger Cruise” and 2005s “Racing Stripes”.

        More recently, he starred in an episode of “The Walking Dead” in 2019, as well as 2022s “Love and Love Not”.
