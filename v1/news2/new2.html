    <h1>STEVE Harvey has been left "scared" of a Family Feud contestant after their intense face-off
        response on stage.</h1>
    <p>The gameshow's network shared the clip of the interaction on the Family Feud Instagram account.During
        one of the episode's contestant face-offs, Steve, 66, asked: "Tell me something that's known as a
        bloodsucker?"
        Laura, one of the two players competing for their teams immediately smashed the buzzer and growled
        out: "A man!"
        The comedian appeared to be disturbed by the answer as he stood motionless with a pleading, "help
        me" expression on his face.
        The studio audience could be heard laughing at Laura's response and the game show host's fearful
        reaction to it.
