    <h1>Former child star Frankie Muniz now a professional racing driver</h1>
    <p>Frankie Muniz is finally getting to live his dream.

        The child star was a staple on screens throughout the early 2000s, starring as the lead in the TV series Malcolm
        in the Middle and the Agent Cody Banks movies among other roles.

        Now 37 years old, Muniz’s career is set to take a swift detour after he announced that he will be competing in
        NASCAR’s ARCA Menards Series championship this year, The Sun reports.

        He will be driving the No. 30 Ford Mustang for Rette Jones Racing, and in doing so, completing a lifelong dream.

        This marks the culmination of an almost two-decade-long journey in racing, which started back in 2006 after
        Malcolm in the Middle came to an end.

        According to NASCAR, he kicked off his new career in open-wheel single-seater racing, before competing in the
        Formula BMW USA Championships.

        Then from 2007-09, Muniz called the Champ Car Atlantic Championship home.

        Unfortunately, his racing career took a nasty turn for the worst when an accident at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car
        Course left him with a broken back and a left thumb that had essentially been “ripped off.”

        This reportedly caused him to lose his potential IndyCar contract for 2010.

        But this speedhump clearly didn’t stop him in the long run.

        Rette Jones Racing’s Mark Rette said that they were “very excited to welcome Frankie Muniz to the Rette Jones
        Racing family for the full 2023 ARCA Menards Series schedule.

        “Over the years, we’ve prided ourselves on working with new drivers who have quickly adapted to the diversity of
        the ARCA Menards Series and, without a doubt, we believe Frankie can do the same.

        “It is not going to be easy, and there will be a learning curve. But with his passion, focus and commitment
        along with the capabilities of our team, we believe we are going to put him in a position to contend for
        multiple wins in 2023.”
