            <title>Underdog</title>
            <description>This review was written for the theatrical release of
                "Underdog"."Underdog", the live-action Disney film based on the Saturday morning
                cartoon series that ran from 1964-73, has a tail-wagging sense of wit and fun but
                gets undone by an increasingly lame story and physical gags in the latter phases of
                the movie. Still, the movie isn't nearly as bad as you would expect when the studio
                holds its only press screening the night before a national opening. The film kids
                superhero movies even as it opens the way for clever canine jokes that do make the
                movie something of an underdog.</description>
