                intense face-off response on stage..</title>
            <description>The gameshow's network shared the clip of the interaction on the Family
                Feud Instagram account.During one of the episode's contestant face-offs, Steve, 66,
                asked: "Tell me something that's known as a bloodsucker?" Laura, one of the two
                players competing for their teams immediately smashed the buzzer and growled out: "A
                man!" The comedian appeared to be disturbed by the answer as he stood motionless
                with a pleading, "help me" expression on his face. The studio audience could be
                heard laughing at Laura's response and the game show host's fearful reaction to it.</description>
